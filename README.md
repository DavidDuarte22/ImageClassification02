# ImageClassification02: Identify some foods using a trained neural network.
Using SwiftUI, Vision, CreateML and CoreML 

Similar to ImageClassification02 but creating the model using a custom dataset. 
Trained with a dataset of food images using Create ML. It shows the result of the three main food that can identify. 

You can choose a food picture from your library, camera or live. 

Foods loaded for train the neural network: apple, banana, cake, candy, carrot, cookie, doughnut, grape, hot dog, ice cream, juice, muffin, orange, pineapple, popcorn, pretzel, salad, strawberry, waffle, watermelon.

To go deep in machine learning models look ImageClassification03 where I used TuriCreate.
